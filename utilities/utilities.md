Within this folder, you'll find additional tools for working with the Allen Institute Cell Types data.

For example, the "Compare cell features" notebook will load a pre-computed dataset containing measurements such as cell surface area, dendrite type, rheobase, input resistance,  and tau so that students can observe the relationship between these features. 

The cell_metrics.csv dataset was created from the Allen Institute Cell Types dataset with the "Generate metrics dataset" notebook.
