# Cell Types Lesson <i>(under development)</i>
### This repository provides background information on the Allen Cell Types lesson plan.
In the first part of the lesson, you'll interact with the Allen Institute website to compare different cell types. Then, you'll dive into the data yourself, to compare mouse and human cells.

You can get started <a href="https://github.com/ajuavinett/CellTypesLesson/wiki/About-this-lab">here</a>.
