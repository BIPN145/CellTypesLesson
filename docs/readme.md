# Cell Types Lesson <i>(under development)</i>
### This repository provides background information on the Allen Cell Types lesson plan.
In the first part of the lesson, you'll interact with the Allen Institute website to compare different cell types. Then, you'll dive into the data yourself, to compare mouse and human cells.

## Steps to completing this lesson

### 1. Read the background information
* <a href="https://ajuavinett.github.io/CellTypesLesson/cell_types">About the Allen Institute Cell Types Dataset</a>
* <a href="https://ajuavinett.github.io/BIPN145/computing_basics">Computing Basics</a>

### 2. Complete the introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

### 3. Follow <a href="http://ajuavinett.github.io/CellTypesLesson/instructions">these instructions</a> to use the Allen's web interface to look at two different cells

### 4. Dive into a Jupyter Notebook to analyze data however you'd like!
