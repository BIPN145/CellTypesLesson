# Cell Types Lesson <i>(under development)</i>
### This repository provides code & background information to complete a lesson plan that explores various cell types in the brain, using the Allen Brain Institute Cell Types dataset.
In the first part of the lesson, you'll interact with the Allen Institute website to compare different cell types. Then, you'll dive into the data yourself, to compare mouse and human cells.
