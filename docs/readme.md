# Cell Types Lesson <i>(under development)</i>
### This site provides code & background information to complete a lesson plan that explores various cell types in the brain, using the <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/">Allen Brain Institute</a> Cell Types dataset.

In this computer lab, we’ll look at open-source data from mouse and human recordings in order to compare cell types from these creatures. We’ll dive into some of the different structures of dendrites, and how these might relate to the shape of their action potentials, and ultimately their role in neural computation.

## Learning objectives:
* Practice using Jupyter notebooks to run Python code and access the AllenSDK
* Understand the metrics that we can use to compare cell types
* Compare electrophysiological characteristics between humans and mice

In the first part of the lesson, you'll interact with the Allen Institute website to compare different cell types. Then, you'll dive into the data yourself, to compare mouse and human cells.

## Steps to completing this lesson

1. Read a bit about where this data comes from, and how we can interact with it
* <a href="https://ajuavinett.github.io/CellTypesLesson/background">About the Allen Institute Cell Types Dataset</a>
* <a href="https://ajuavinett.github.io/BIPN145/computing_basics">Computing Basics</a><br/>

2. Follow <a href="https://ajuavinett.github.io/CellTypesLesson/instructions">these instructions</a> to use the Allen's web interface to look at two different cells.

3. Dive into a Jupyter Notebook to analyze data however you'd like! <i>Before starting this part</i>, you should complete the CodeAcademy tutorial for Python3 syntax, or a similar tutorial that covers the basics of variables, `print ( )`, and arithmetic in Python.
