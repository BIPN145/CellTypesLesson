# Cell Types Lesson

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ajuavinett/CellTypesLesson/master)

#### This GitHub site provides code & background information to complete a lesson plan that explores various cell types in the brain, using the <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/">Allen Brain Institute</a> Cell Types dataset.

In this computer lab, we’ll look at open-source data from mouse and human recordings in order to compare cell types from these creatures. We’ll dive into some of the different structures of dendrites, and how these might relate to the shape of their action potentials, and ultimately their role in neural computation.

## Learning objectives:
* Practice using Jupyter notebooks to run Python code and access the AllenSDK
* Understand the metrics that we can use to compare cell types
* Compare electrophysiological characteristics between humans and mice

In the first part of the lesson, you'll interact with the Allen Institute website to compare different cell types. Then, you'll dive into the data yourself, to compare mouse and human cells.

<i>Before diving in</i>, it would help to have very introductory working knowledge of Python. I'd recommend <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3">this CodeAcademy tutorital for Python3</a>, which covers the basics of variables, `print()`, and arithmetic in Python.

Please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/neuroedu/cell-types">this website</a> for a full description of the activities contained here.
